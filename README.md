## Setup Instructions

This project utilizes the Bun runtime. To install dependencies, execute:

```bash
bun install
```

Alternatively, delete the lock file and use npm for installation:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, duplicate the `.env.example` file, fill in the necessary details, and your setup is complete.

Before proceeding, review the code to ensure everything is correctly set up. The `example.ts` script contains the core logic.

## Running the Script

To execute the script with Bun, use:

```bash
bun run ./scripts/example.ts
```

Alternatively, to run with npm:
